# The Brew Ha Ha API

The Brew Ha Ha API is a Django REST Framework project for managing snack and drink orders at a caf√©-style establishment. It allows customers to:

* Browse available snacks and drinks in the database
* Place orders containing one or more items
* Retrieve details of orders

The API uses Django REST Framework serializers and views to handle data input and output.
